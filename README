three.js and JigLibJS Demo

This is a demo I put together while I was testing out some HTML5 3D JavaScript engines and JavaScript physics engines. The ones I chose to attempt to integrate were three.js and JigLibJS. This particular demo is running three.js r34 and JigLibJS v0.9.0.2.

JigLibJS - https://github.com/supereggbert/JigLibJS/

At some point, I'm sure these libraries need to be updated within this demo, but everything works for now. Read my writeup here:
